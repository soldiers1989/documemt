Pixel Densities

Android icons require five separate sizes for different screen pixel densities. Icons for lower resolution are created automatically from the baseline.

--- | --- | ---
mdpi (Baseline) |	160 dpi	| 1×
hdpi |	240 dpi |	1.5×
xhdpi |	320 dpi	| 2×
xxhdpi |	490 dpi	| 3×
xxxhdpi |	640 dpi	| 4×
